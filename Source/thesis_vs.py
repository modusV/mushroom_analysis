## Dataset load and overall view
# Let's start importing the data:

#%%
# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("./Input/mushrooms.csv")
# dataset = pd.read_csv("./mushrooms.csv")

#%%
# Shape of the dataset
print("The dataset has %d rows and %d columns." % dataset.shape)

#%% [markdown]
# We will look now at the dataset to understand what are the different fields and their types:
#%%
# Count number of classes for classification
print(f"There are {dataset['class'].unique().size} different classes:"
      f"\n {dataset['class'].unique().tolist()}")

# Count number of unique data for every column
print(f"Unique values for every field: \n{dataset.nunique()}")

#%% [markdown]
# We can notice that `veil-type` has just one value, therefore that column is useless
# for our analysis. We will remove it later.  
# 
# We can now look deeper inside the dataset. Thanks to the pandas library, we can 
# see all the fields of the dataset with the respective values.

#%% [markdown]
# <a id='preprocessing'></a>
## Preprocessing

# Before starting the classification phase, we need to preprocess the dataset, in 
# such a way that our classifiers will score with more accuracy and reliability. 
# This is the most important step, if data are messy the classification will perform 
# poorly.

# The steps that we will go trough are:  
# 
# 1. Check data types  
# 2. Remove not significat columns, if any  
# 3. Remove null values and duplicates, if any
# 4. Encode string values
# 5. Check class distribution and, if classes are unbalanced, apply balancing techniques
# 6. Check data distribution using of bar graphs and box plots
# 7. Analyze correlation matrix to understand which fields are more important to classify our samples
# 8. Divide the dataset in classes array and unclassified samples
# 9. Scale our data, in such a way to center and standardize them

#%% [markdown]
# ### 1 - Check data types
#%%
# See data types 
print("Data types:")
dataset.head(5)

#%% [markdown]
# From the above snippet we can notice that the fields are all string values; 
# converting them to numeric values will make our analysis much easier. We will use a
# library called `LabelEncoder`. It allows us with a few line of code to create a mapping
# of every value in each field and transform the data in this way. We can go back to the 
# original mapping simply using the `inverse_transform` function.  
#
# Before this step though, we will firstly remove all the useless columns, in this 
# case just `veil-type`.

#%% [markdown]
# ### 2 - Remove any not significant column
# Now we will remove all the fields that do not add any information to our analysis,
# specifically, the fields that contain only one value (zero variance).
#%% 
n_columns_original = len(dataset.columns)
to_drop = [col for col in dataset.columns if dataset[col].nunique() == 1]
dataset.drop(to_drop, axis=1, inplace=True)

for d in to_drop:
    print(str(d) + " ", end="")
print("have been removed because they have zero variance")
print(f"{n_columns_original - len(dataset.columns)} not significant columns have been removed")

#%% [markdown]
# As we can notice, only one field was removed. 

#%% [markdown]
# ### 3 - Handling missing values
# When we find any missing value in a dataset, there are different 
# approaches that can be considered:  
#
# 1. Delete all rows containing a missing value
# 2. Substitute with a constant value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values.
# 3. Substitute with a value from another randomly selected record.
# 4. Substitute with mean, median or mode value for the column.
# 5. Substitute with a value estimated by another predictive model.  
#
# 
# We will approach this problem using the first and the second techniques:
# 
# 1. We will create a parallel dataset in which all the rows containing a missing 
# value will be dropped, classifying 
# them as incomplete samples. This may cause a large decrement in the dataset size
# but is the only way
# to be sure that we are not going to influence our classification algorithm in any
# way. 
# 
# 2. It is evident from the `dataset.head()` function that our fileds are composed
# by all string values. 
# Given the fact that we would need to translate in any case every field to a
# numeric one, to better display 
# them in graphs, a simple approach is to keep the missing data as a peculiar number
# different from the others,
# and simply apply the transformation as they were present.
# 
#
# In any case, let's start counting how many null/missing values we will find.
#%%
# Check if any field is null
if dataset.isnull().any().any():
    print("There are some null values")
else:
    print("There are no null values")
#%% [markdown]
# It may seem that we have no missing value from the previous analysis... Great!
# 
# But wait a minute ... If we look better,from the data description we can notice that in the field 
# `stalk-root` there are some missing values, marked with the question mark; let's count how many of them there are:

#%%
print("There are " + str((dataset['stalk-root'] == "?").sum()) + " missing values in stalk-root column")

#%% [markdown]
# More than 25% of our samples is incomplete. Dropping all those rows may lead to a shortage of samples.
# This is why we will use the two approaches and see which one performs better.
# In any case, we will replace those value with another character. 
# We will use the character `m` to indicate a missing value

#%%

dataset['stalk-root'] = dataset['stalk-root'].replace({"?": "m"})
print(dataset['stalk-root'].unique())

#%% [markdown]
# Beore we continue, let's check if there are any duplicates in our data - meaning, 
# do we know of two or more mushrooms with exactly the same features?

#%%
print('Known mushrooms: {}\nUnique mushrooms: {}'.format(len(dataset.index),len(dataset.drop_duplicates().index)))
#%% [markdown]
# Perfect! But wait, are there any equal mushrooms but with different class?

#%%
print('Known mushrooms: {}\nMushrooms with same features: {}'.format(
    len(dataset.index),
    len(dataset.drop_duplicates(subset=dataset.drop(['class'], axis=1)
    .columns).index)))
#%% [markdown]
# Very good, two mushrooms with the same features having different classes may be really
# dangerous. 
#%% [markdown]
# ### 4 - Encode string values
# As already said, we need to encode all the string values into integers, in such a way to continue our analysis in a more easy way. 
#%%

#%% [markdown]
# As we can see data have been transformed; all the strings values now are equal to integers, 
# and we can see the direct corrispondence from the table above.
#
# We have encoded our dataset but, depending on the data (as in our case), label encoding may 
# introduce a new problem. For example, we have encoded a set of colour names 
# into numerical data. This is actually categorical data and there is no relation, 
# of any kind, between the rows. 
# 
# The problem here is, since there are different numbers in the same column, 
# the model will misunderstand the data to be in some kind of order, 0 < 1 < 2. 
# But this isn’t the case at all. To overcome this problem, we use `OneHotEncoder`.
#
# What one hot encoding does is, it takes a column which has categorical data, 
# which has been label encoded, and then splits the column into multiple columns. 
# The numbers are replaced by 1s and 0s, depending on which column has what value.
# 
# We will obtain two datasets; the one Label Encoded contains values that have no 
# geometrical interpretation (we cannot use classified based on distances such as kNN).
# The other one, on the other hand, will be bigger but with more data significance.
#
# We also drop the column with missing value, beacuse it is not significative.

# ### 5/6 - Check class and data distribution
#In this phase, we will analyze the distribution of the data. The steps will be:
#
# 1. Check amount of samples belonging to a class or to another.
# 2. Analyze the overall distribution using box plots, a very useful tool to identify outliers and values taken by samples. 
# 3. Compare the two classes distributions with the help of an histogram.

#%% [markdown]
# #### 5 - Check classes distribution
# Let's see how many samples belong to the different classes
#%%
y = dataset["class"].value_counts()
print(y)
class_dict = ["edible", "poisonous"]

#%% [markdown]
# Luckily the dataset is pretty balanced: 
# We have almost the same amount of samples in a class and in the other; this simplifies the analysis because we can assign the same weight to the two classes in the classification phase.
# 
# Moreover, we can notice that the classification task will be binary. Infact, data have been transformed, and now the labels are represented with a 0/1 integer value. 
# Now we can look deeper into some statistical details about the dataset, using the `pre_df.describe()` command on our pandas DataFrame dataset. The output shows:
# 
# - count: number of samples (rows)
# - mean: the mean of the attribute among all samples
# - std: the standard deviation of the attribute
# - min: the minimal value of the attribute
# - 25%: the lower percentile
# - 50%: the median
# - 75%: the upper percentile
# - max: the maximal value of the attribute

# #### 6 - Box plot
# 
# At this point we can analyze the distribution of our data using a boxplot. 
# A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”). 
#
# It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. 
# It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped,and if and how your data is skewed.
# The information that we can find in a box plot are:
# 
# - **median** (Q2/50th Percentile): the middle value of the dataset.
# - **first quartile** (Q1/25th Percentile): the middle number between the smallest number (not the “minimum”) and the median of the dataset.
# - **third quartile** (Q3/75th Percentile): the middle value between the median and the highest value (not the “maximum”) of the dataset.
# - **interquartile range** (IQR): 25th to the 75th percentile.
# - **outliers** (shown as green circles)
# - **maximum**: Q3 + 1.5*IQR
# - **minimum**: Q1 -1.5*IQR
#
# It makes no sense showing binary or with few different values fields, so we are going to filter them before plotting.

# From the boxplot above, we can see that the color and the shape of the 
# cap are not an effective parameter to decide whether a mushroom is 
# poisonous or edible, because their plots are very similar (same median 
# and very close distribution). 
# The `odor` and the `population` columns, on the other hand, are more significant; 
# 
# In the `odor` field, all the edible mushrooms are squeezed into a single value
# with a few outliers, while the poisonous may have all the different values.

# ### 7 - Correlation matrix
# A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between sets of variables. 
# Each random variable (Xi) in the table is correlated with each of the other values in the table (Xj). 
# This allows you to see which pairs have the highest correlation. Correlation is any statistical association, 
# though in common usage it most often refers to how close two variables are to having 
# a linear relationship with each other.
# 
# We will use the **Pearson's correlation**, which is a measure of the linear correlation 
# between two variables X and Y. According to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality it has a value 
# between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, 
# and −1 is total negative linear correlation.
# 
# The coefficient for a population is computed as:
# 
# $\rho_{(X,Y)} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$
# 
# Where:
# - $cov$ is the covariance:
#   - $cov(X,Y) = \frac{E[(X - \mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$
#    - Where $\mu$ is the mean value  
# 
# - $\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of X
#   - $\sigma_X^2 = E[X^2] - [E[X]]^2$
# - $\sigma_Y$ is the standard deviation of Y
#   - $\sigma_Y^2 = E[Y^2] - [E[Y]]^2$

# But wait, does this really makes sense? Didn't we see form the boxplot that the odor
# was very important to determine the class? Here it doesn't seem so ...
#
# This is because we performed a geometrical analysis on a dataset that has been encoded
# with arbitrary values! Looking at the Pearson's correlation formula, how do we subtract 
# *green* from the *average* of colors?
#
# To obtain a consistent result, we could plot the correlation matrix using the One Hot Encoded dataset, but the problem is that
# we would obtain a huge matrix showing correlation between every combination of values that
# our features may have, which is not that significative for our analysis.
#
# Due to all these problems, we will need something that looks like the correlation,
# but works with categorical features. 
# We need then a *measure of association* between features,
# but on contrary of a simple Pearson's correlation, we would need something that is not symmetrical,
# because otherwise we risk to lose information such as:
#
# - feature *x* implies label *y* does not imply that label *y* implies features *x*
#
#
# **Theil's U**, also referred as **Uncertanty Coefficient**, suits our situation perfectly.
# It is based on the conditional entropy between the variables *x* and *y*; in other words, 
# given the value *x*, shows how many states does *y* have, and how often they occurr.
# Its output is between $[0,1]$ and it is asymmetric ( $U(x,y) \ne U(y,x)$ )
#
# The coefficient is defined as:
#
# - $U(X|Y) = \frac{H(X) - H(X|Y)}{H(X)}$
# - where:
#   - $H(X) = -\Sigma_x{P_X(x) logP_X(x)}$

# ### 7 - Dendogram
# A **dendrogram** is a diagram representing a tree. This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts, but we will see the case representing hierarchical clustering. 
#
# It illustrates the arrangement of the clusters, and its objective is to analyze if we have any duplicate features. In order to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset, we can identify and remove duplicate features according to their pairwise correlation with others.
# 
# The linkage criterion determines the distance between sets of observations as a function of the pairwise distances between observations.
# We will use the between-group average linkage (UPGMA). Proximity between two clusters is the arithmetic mean of all the proximities between the objects of one, on one side, and the objects of the other, on the other side.
# The method is frequently set the default one in hierarhical clustering packages.

#%% [markdown]
# ### 8/9 - Scale and divide data

# Most of the times, datasets contain features highly varying in magnitudes, units and range. 
# But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Euclidean distance between two 
# data points in their computations, this is a problem. If left alone, these algorithms 
# only take in the magnitude of features neglecting the units. The results would vary greatly 
# between different units, for example between 5kg and 5000gms. 
# 
# The features with high magnitudes will weigh in a lot more in the 
# distance calculations than features with low magnitudes.
# To supress this effect, we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. 
# This can be acheived by scaling.
# 
# We will use the `StandardScaler`, which standardizes our data both with mean and 
# standard deviation.
#
# The operation performed will be:
#
# $$
# x' = \frac{x - \mu_x}{\sigma_x}
# $$

# After this step, we divide the dataset into an array of unclassified samples 
# and an array of labels, to use for the classification phase.
# 
# At the end, we decide to bring to the next step of our analysis 
# different datasets:
# 
# 1. The full dataset Label Encoded, where the missing values are encoded with an integer.
# 2. A reduced version of the dataset, where the rows with missing data are considered as 
#   incomplete samples and are dropped.
# 3. The full dataset Label Encoded, with `stalk-root`field dropped.

# ## Principal component analysis
# When our data are represented by a matrix too large (the number of dimensions is too high), it is 
# difficult to extract the most interesting features and find correlations among them; moreover the space 
# occupied is very high. PCA is a technique that allows to achieve dimensionality reduction while preserving 
# the most important differences among samples. 
# 
# This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest 
# possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and 
# each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it 
# is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination 
# of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set.
#
# Please note that we can apply PCA only on the One Hot Encoded dataset, because values in the Label Encoded one
# does not have any geometrical meaning.
#
# Let's calculate the Principal Components and show their retained variance on a bar graph.

    Generate a simple plot of the test and training learning curve.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object type that implements the "fit" and "predict" methods
        An object of that type which is cloned for each validation.

    title : string
        Title for the chart.

    X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Training vector, where n_samples is the number of samples and
        n_features is the number of features.

    y : array-like, shape (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_features), optional
        Target relative to X for classification or regression;
        None for unsupervised learning.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
          - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
          - integer, to specify the number of folds.
          - :term:`CV splitter`,
          - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if ``y`` is binary or multiclass,
        :class:`StratifiedKFold` used. If the estimator is not a classifier
        or if ``y`` is neither binary nor multiclass, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validators that can be used here.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    train_sizes : array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float or int
        Relative or absolute numbers of training examples that will be used to
        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined
        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].
        Otherwise it is interpreted as absolute sizes of the training sets.
        Note that for classification the number of samples usually have to
        be big enough to contain at least one sample from each class.

# As we can see, the most accurate on average is the dataset encoded with `OneHotEncoder`; The training time though, is really high 
# with respect to the other datasets. 
# If we look carefully, we achieve an optimal score using the Random Forest Classifier on the full dataset, without any parameter 
# tuning, in a short time. This indicates that the dataset is easily classified, even without the use of more complicated methods.
#
# For demonstrative purposes, for now on we will use the dataset One Hot Encoded, but the compressed version, to 
# see how the accuracy can improve by means of parameter tuning in a reasonable time. 
# This dataset allows us to use all the classification models mentioned above.

# ### Logistic Regression
# The first classifier that we will analyze is the Logistic Regression classifier. It uses the 
# sigmoid function to classify our samples:
#
# - $P(y=0 | X;\theta) = g(w^T X) = \frac{1}{1+e^{w^T X}}$
# - $P(y=1 | X;\theta) = 1 - g(w^T X) = \frac{e^{w^T X}}{1+e^{w^T X}}$
# 
# 
# This model, with respect to linear regression, can model better the zone close to 
# 0 and 1. To learn the weights, the $MLE$ is found and then the gradient descent algorithm 
# is applied until the accuracy converges.
#
# They are:
# - `liblinear`. Solver, which is better for smaller datasets
# - `C`. Regularization strength, ranging from 0.01 to 100. A smaller value inidicates stronger regularization, like in svms.
# - `penalty`. "l1" and "l2" penalty for regularization, which are defined as:
#   - l1, it penalizes every mistake at the same way
#       - $S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{|y_i - f(x_i)|}$
#    
#   - l2, it penalizes bigger values
#       - $S = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - f(x_i))^2}$
#  
#   - Where $y_i$ is the true label and $f(x_i)$ is the assigned label.

# ### Support vector machine
# A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a 
# separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), 
# the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space 
# this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.
# 
# We perform the grid search over:
# - `linear`. This is the simplest SVM, finds the hyperplane which separates in the best way our samples.
# - `C`. The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying 
# each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin 
# hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points 
# classified correctly.
# - `rbf`. This parameter indicates that we are using a radial basis function kernel to perform the 
# scalar product. 
#   - `gamma`. Defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches, 
# with low values meaning ‘far’ and high values meaning ‘close’.

# ### Naive Bayes Classifier
# The naive bayes classifier is based on the Bayes theorem, which states that:
#
# - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
#
# Where:
# - $P(A)$, the prior, is the initial degree of belief in A.
# - $P(A|B)$, the posterior is the degree of belief having accounted for B.
# - $P(B|A$), is the likelyhood, the degree of belief in B, given that A is true.
#
#
# Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, 
# given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made 
# here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular 
# feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.

# To be a really simple classifier, it can achieve decent results. The independecy assumption
# does not work perfectly, because the different features are never completely independent from 
# each other, but nevertheless it manages to achieve a good accuracy even if we used only 
# the data projected on the principal components. 
# 
# With the naive bayes classifier, it is always 
# better to use the original dataset, being really fast itself to train and to classify samples.
# With the ohc dataset, if we look in the upper table, we achieve a score around 0.945, which is 
# a great score given our big assumption.

# ### Random Forest Classifier
# It is a tree-based method, derived from bagging decision trees, to which
# it is added another small trick which decorrelates the trees, in order to 
# reduce further the variance. 
#
# As in bagging, we build a number of decision trees on bootstrapped training 
# samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree 
# is considered, a random selection of m predictors is chosen as split 
# candidates from the full set of p predictors. The split is allowed to use only 
# one of those m predictors, which typically are $m \approx \sqrt{p}$.

# Here we just see which are the components that weight more in the classification, but due to the 
# fact that we reduced the dataset by means of PCA, we only see which component weighted more in
# the node splitting phase. Why the last components weight more than the first, the ones
# which contain most of the variability?
#
# The first principal component is a linear combination of all our features. The fact that it explains almost all the 
# variability just means that most of the coefficients of the variables in the first principal component are significant.
# The classification trees we generate do binary splits on 
# continuous variables that best separate the categories we want to classify. That is not exactly 
# the same as finding orthogonal linear combinations of continuous variables that give the direction 
# of greatest variance. 

#%% [markdown]
# ### K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
# K-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function 
# is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. 
# The K-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.
# 
# The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors 
# and class labels of the training samples. In the classification phase, K is a user-defined constant, 
# and an unlabeled vector (a query or test point) is classified by assigning the label which 
# is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that query point.
# 
# The parameters for cross validation are:
# - `n_neighbors`. Number of closes samples to analyze
# - `weights`. Indicates the weight function to use in prediction.
#   - `uniform`. All points in the neighborhood are weighted equally.
#   - `distance`. Weight points by the inverse of their distance. 
# In this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a greater 
# influence than neighbors which are further away.
# - `p`. Power parameter for the Minkowski metric (generalization of Euclidean distance)
#   - p=1 uses `l1`
#   - p=2 uses `l2`
#   - p>2 minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

# - $TRP/Recall/Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
# - $FPR = \frac{FP}{TN+FP}$

# separability. A poor model has AUC near to the 0 which means it has worst measure
